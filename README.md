# Project 2 Website with a Search Engine

### Overview of the Project

The overview of the project is to offer a search engine within the website itself so that users can search for images based on keywords typed into the search box, and generate images. It also offers a button that will allow the user to clear any current searches for new ones. 
It requires the following features: a GitHub respository for the project, user stories, wireframes of each application window (desktop and mobile views), and functional website features. It is comprised of one HTML page, a CSS style sheet, a Javascript page, a navigation bar, a Google font, an input field for the search engine box, a submit button, a clear button, generate Giphy images based on typed keyword, 15+ GitHub commits, and no HTML validator errors/warnings.

### Functionality of the Website

The Home page offers a navigation bar at the top. In the center of the page is a Search engine box that allows a keyword to be typed in (at the user's preference/need), and generates twenty-five images based upon the word used in the center of the page below the box. Next to the search engine box is a 'Submit' button as well as a 'Clear' button so that the user can clear each search before starting a new one.

### Technologies Utilized

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript (as well as Async/Await)

### Ideas for Future Improvement

1. Add the option for the user to send themselves an image(s) to their email.
2. Create the option for users to generate images based upon multiple keywords inputted simultaneously.
3. Add more images per search than the current 25 images.
4. Add the option for users to check their personal search history.

### User Stories

1. As a user, I want to type keywords in the search box so that it results in related Giphy images.
2. As a grandparent, I want to find funny Giphy images so that I can show my grandchildren when they come over to my house.
3. As a student, I want to find Giphy images so that I can copy and paste them for my classroom Power Point.
