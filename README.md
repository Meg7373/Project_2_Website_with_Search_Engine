### Overview/Description of the Project
The overview of the project is to offer a search engine within the website itself so that users can search for images based on keywords typed into the search box, and generate images. It also offers a button that will allow the user to clear any current searches for new ones. 
It requires the following features: a GitHub respository for the project, user stories, wireframes of each application window (desktop and mobile views), and functional website features. It is comprised of one HTML page, a CSS style sheet, a Javascript page, a navigation bar, a Google font, an input field for the search engine box, a submit button, a clear button, generate Giphy images based on typed keyword, 15+ GitHub commits, and no HTML validator errors/warnings.
